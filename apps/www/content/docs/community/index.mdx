  {' '}
  Community components live under `registry/components/community` and follow the
  same documentation and demo structure as core components.
</Callout>

The **Community** section showcases components contributed by other developers.  
These components follow the same principles as Azemmur’s — accessible, animated, and composable — but come from the community instead of the core registry.

## Purpose

The community section exists to:

- Highlight shared creativity from open-source contributors.
- Encourage experimentation and new UI concepts.
- Provide real examples of how Azemmur components can be extended or reimagined.
- Create a growing library of diverse, practical, and aesthetic designs.

## Current Status

We’re actively inviting contributions — motion experiments, accessibility improvements, and new interactive designs are all welcome.

Unlike core Azemmur components, community components are not curated as part of the main registry and may explore alternative APIs, visuals, or interaction patterns.

> Your contribution helps shape what Azemmur becomes — a shared library of accessible, animated creativity.

## How to contribute

If you want to add a community component:

1. Follow the standard contribution flow.
2. Place your component under `registry/components/community`.
3. Add a demo and documentation using the same structure as core components.
