The **Community** section showcases components contributed by other developers and designers.  
These components follow the same principles as Azemmur’s — accessible, animated, and composable — but come from the community instead of the core registry.

## Purpose

The community section exists to:
- Highlight shared creativity from open-source contributors.  
- Encourage experimentation and new UI concepts.  
- Provide real examples of how Azemmur components can be extended or reimagined.  
- Create a growing library of diverse, practical, and aesthetic designs.  


## Current Status

We’re actively inviting contributions — motion experiments, accessibility improvements, and new interactive designs are all welcome.

>  Your contribution helps shape what Azemmur becomes — a shared library of accessible, animated creativity.
