Animations bring interfaces to life — they guide attention, communicate state, and create flow.  
But not everyone experiences motion the same way. For some users, strong or continuous animations can cause **discomfort, dizziness, or distraction**.

At Azemmur, accessibility is a **core principle** — every animated interaction should feel **intentional, subtle, and inclusive**. That’s why all Azemmur components are built with **Reduced Motion** support through [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

## Prefers Reduced Motion

Modern operating systems and browsers expose a setting called **Reduced Motion** (`prefers-reduced-motion`).  
When enabled, it tells applications that the user prefers **less movement** or **simpler transitions**.

Typical adjustments include:

- Avoiding large-scale movement (translate, rotate, scale)
- Preferring soft opacity fades or color transitions
- Disabling parallax or looping background animations
- Reducing motion in interactive elements

The goal isn’t to remove animation entirely — it’s to keep motion **comfortable, clear, and user-controlled**.

## Motion Integration

Azemmur components are powered by [Motion](https://motion.dev/), which provides built-in accessibility tools for managing reduced motion preferences.

To ensure your app respects user preferences globally, wrap your application in a `MotionConfig` component:

```tsx
import { MotionConfig } from 'motion/react';

export function App({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return <MotionConfig reducedMotion="user">{children}</MotionConfig>;
}
````

With `reducedMotion="user"`, Motion automatically:

* Disables transform and layout animations when Reduced Motion is enabled.
* Keeps helpful, subtle effects (like opacity or background-color transitions).
* Ensures all Azemmur components adapt without extra configuration.

## Design Philosophy

Accessibility in animation is about **balance** — creating expressive interactions that remain **comfortable and inclusive** for all users.
Azemmur embraces this principle by default: every component aims to be **beautiful, animated, and accessible**.

> **Inclusive motion is thoughtful motion.**
> When animation enhances usability instead of overwhelming it, design becomes universal.

## Recommendation

We recommend adding:

```tsx
<MotionConfig reducedMotion="user" />
```

at the **root level** of your app to ensure all animations respect system preferences.

**Accessibility is not optional** — it’s a design choice that empowers everyone to enjoy your interface, comfortably and confidently.
