**Azemmur** began as a personal space to organize my React components — and evolved into a way to give back to the developer community. It’s an **open-source distribution** of **React components**, built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev/), based on the shadcn registry and inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Animate UI](https://animate-ui.com).

Each component is crafted to be **accessible**, **animated**, and **international** by design — with the goal of **organizing, refining, and sharing** self-built components as a community resource. Azemmur exists to make **well-crafted UI pieces** accessible, performant, and ready for global use.

## Built to share and evolve

Azemmur isn’t a library you install from npm — it’s an **open, evolving collection** of components you can copy, modify, and adapt to your projects. By keeping the source open, developers can **learn**, **contribute**, and **grow together** through a shared ecosystem of reusable UI patterns.

## Core principles

- **Accessible** — Built following accessibility best practices for inclusive, user-friendly experiences.
- **Animated** — Powered by Motion, with expressive animation patterns that make interfaces feel alive.
- **International (i18n)** — Designed with global audiences in mind, supporting multi-language integration.
- **Performant** — Lightweight, responsive, and optimized for modern development.
- **Aesthetic** — Minimal and elegant by default, yet easy to adapt to any design system.

## Why Azemmur?

Azemmur is about **sharing craftsmanship** — creating UI that looks great, feels smooth, and performs beautifully. It’s not just a personal project; it’s an open invitation to developers who value thoughtful design and accessible technology.

1. **A personal contribution to the community** — Sharing knowledge and reusable UI as open code.
2. **Community-driven** — Open to contributions, discussions, and shared creativity.
3. **Flexible and transparent** — No wrappers or abstractions — just composable components you control.
4. **Aesthetic and practical** — Designed to balance beauty, usability, and performance.
5. **Open source forever** — Built to grow collaboratively and remain free for everyone.

## Open collaboration

Azemmur is open source and welcomes community contributions.  
It aims to become a shared space for **beautiful, maintainable UI patterns** — created by developers, for developers.
