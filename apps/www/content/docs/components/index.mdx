Azemmur’s **Components** section contains a curated collection of reusable React components —  
built with **Tailwind CSS**, **Motion**, and **class-variance-authority (CVA)**.  
These are the personal components originally built for Azemmur projects, now made available to explore, reuse, and adapt freely.

> Think of these as _templates with purpose_ — a starting point for your own UI system.

## Customization

All components are intentionally open — modify the structure, styling, motion logic, or variants as needed.
Each component acts as **source code**, not a black box.

You can:

- Edit Tailwind classes directly.
- Add new variants in the `cva()` call.
- Extend motion behaviors or transitions.
- Merge components with your own design system.
